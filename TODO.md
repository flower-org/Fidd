- Cryptor: Decompose MainForm into individual components.
  - +Key chooser decomposed
  - For now, I intend to keep the lower half in a single lump though, it doesn't really seem reusable to me.
- Cryptor: Unit test coverage
- Cryptor: Add a nice README.md with screenshots
- Cryptor: Decompose common deps into reusable GitHub repos
- Cryptor: Review RSATransformer, AESTransformer - reduce code duplication, extract and move common logic to PkiUtil.
  - +Somewhat refactored
  - Review further to see if anything reusable can go to PkiUtil
- Cryptor: Add support for more ciphers
  - e.g
    - asymmetric: ECDSA, Ed25519 (EdDSA) 
    - symmetric: Blowfish, Twofish, ChaCha20, Magma/GOST (ГОСТ 28147-89, RFC 5830/8891), Kuznyechik (ГОСТ Р 34.12-2015, RFC 7801)
  - low prio, needs a good reason - for now RSA / AES-256 cover all bases for me
- Fidd: AES / RSA-AES Decryptor Input Stream
  - Provides great value for reusability, and is a cornerstone component of Fidd infra
  - Some POC, like an HTTP file/media server for encrypted files
  - Not a dependency of Cryptor
